# Liwin

Liwin is a lightweight platform-agnostic windowing library for Rust. It is designed to be used in
games and other applications that require a simple and easy-to-use windowing library.

## Supported Platforms

- [x] Windows
- [ ] Linux
- [ ] MacOS

## Acknowledgements

Liwin is heavily inspired by `[winit]` but it is designed to be simpler and more lightweight. In
return, Liwin is not as feature-rich as winit. Specifically, Liwin does not support opening
multiple windows.
