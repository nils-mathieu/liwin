# Liwin

Liwin is a lightweight platform-agnostic windowing library for Rust. It is designed to be used in
games and other applications that require a simple and easy-to-use windowing library.

## Supported Platforms

- [ ] Windows (in progress)
- [ ] Linux
- [ ] MacOS

## Acknowledgements

Liwin is heavily inspired by [`winit`] but it is designed to be simpler and more lightweight. In
return, Liwin is not as feature-rich as winit. For example, Liwin does not support opening
multiple windows, and is not DPI aware.
